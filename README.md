## SignaturePatternRecognition
# Identifying Signature with SURF Pattern Recognition on Arduino
# To finish my study in college
# The signature is created by user with Arduino TFT LCD Touchscreen ILI 9341, and connected to Arduino UNO as master then NodeMCU LolinV3 as a slave from Arduino UNO. The signature will be proceed on Flask Pyhton with SURF pattern recognition.
